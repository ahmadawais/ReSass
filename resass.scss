/**
 * ReSass.
 *
 * MIXIN: Responsive Media Queries.
 *
 * Creates responsive media queries for seven different screen sizes.
 * These are based on min-width which means if x is the size then your
 * CSS will affect any device with screen width x and above.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *	@include r(240)  { }
 *	@include r(320)  { }
 *	@include r(480)  { }
 *	@include r(768)  { }
 *	@include r(1024) { }
 *	@include r(1140) { }
 *	@include r(1280) { }
 *  @include r(1500) { }
 *
 * CSS content goes inside {} brackets. These mixins should be used inside
 * a class definition. For example:
 *
 * The following CSS will hide the .header on screen width 320px and above.
 * .header {
 * 	  @include r(320)  { display: none; }
 * }
